                    <h3>.NET Framework</h3>
                    <p> This is the original implementation of the .NET platform, primarily for Windows. It includes a
                        large class library known as the Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language
                        interoperability across several programming languages. It has its version numbering scheme, such
                        as 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, etc.</p>

                    <p>.NET Standard is a specification that defines a set of APIs that all .NET implementations must
                        provide to ensure consistency across different .NET platforms. It's essentially a set of APIs
                        that developers can rely on being available on any .NET implementation that claims to support a
                        particular version of .NET Standard.</p>

                    <p>
                        C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET initiative. It is a
                        simple, modern, object-oriented language designed for building a variety of applications that
                        run on the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and other compatible platforms. C# is widely used for
                        developing desktop, web, and mobile applications within the .NET ecosystem.

                    <p>
                        F# is a functional-first programming language developed by Microsoft Research. It is a 
                        strongly-typed, multi-paradigm language that is part of the .NET ecosystem. F# emphasizes 
                        functional programming concepts such as immutability, higher-order functions, and pattern 
                        matching. It is particularly well-suited for tasks involving parallelism, asynchronous 
                        programming, and data-oriented programming. F# can be used to build a wide range of 
                        applications, including web applications, data processing pipelines, and scientific 
                        computing projects.

                    <h3>VB (Visual Basic)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Visual Basic is a full-fledged programming language developed by Microsoft. It was widely used 
                        for building desktop applications, especially during the 1990s and early 2000s. Visual Basic 
                        provides a simple and intuitive syntax that allows developers to quickly build Windows-based 
                        applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). VB can be compiled into executable files 
                        or run using an interpreter.

                    <h3>VBScript (Visual Basic Scripting Edition)</h3>
                    <p>
                        VBScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language developed by Microsoft and based on 
                        Visual Basic. It is primarily used for client-side and server-side scripting within web 
                        pages and web applications. VBScript is interpreted by web browsers or server-side scripting 
                        engines (like Internet Information Services, or IIS, for ASP applications). VBScript is 
                        typically embedded within HTML documents to add interactivity or perform server-side 
                        processing.

                        It retains the ease of use and familiarity of Visual Basic syntax while incorporating the 
                        features and capabilities of the .NET framework. VB.NET is used primarily for building desktop, 
                        web, and mobile applications within the .NET ecosystem.

                        for building dynamic web pages and web applications. It uses VBScript or JScript as its
                        scripting language and is based on COM (Component Object Model). ASP Classic was the predecessor
                        to ASP.NET and is now considered a legacy technology.</p>

                        applications and services. It provides a robust and scalable environment for developing web
                        applications using various programming languages, including C#, F# and VB.NET. ASP.NET offers features like
                        state management, authentication, and data access. It includes several sub-frameworks, such as
                        Web Forms, MVC (Model-View-Controller), Web API, and Razor Pages, which cater to different
                        application architectures and development styles.</p>

                <p>
                    In summary, .NET is a platform that encompasses multiple implementations like .NET Framework, .NET
                    Core, and now individual "versions" of .NET <span>8</span>, all aiming to provide a unified
                    development and runtime environment for building and running applications. Each flavor of .NET has
                    its own version numbering scheme to denote specific releases and updates, while C# serves as one of
                    the primary programming languages for developing applications within the .NET ecosystem.
