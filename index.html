                    <h3>C#</h3>
                    <p>
                        C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET initiative. It is a
                        simple, modern, object-oriented language designed for building a variety of applications that
                        run on the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and other compatible platforms. C# is widely used for
                        developing desktop, web, and mobile applications within the .NET ecosystem.

                    <p>ASP (Active Server Pages) Classic is a server-side scripting environment developed by Microsoft
                        for building dynamic web pages and web applications. It uses VBScript or JScript as its
                        scripting language and is based on COM (Component Object Model). ASP Classic was the predecessor
                        to ASP.NET and is now considered a legacy technology.</p>

                    <h3>ASP.NET</h3>
                    <p>ASP.NET is a web development framework developed by Microsoft for building modern web
                        applications and services. It provides a robust and scalable environment for developing web
                        applications using various programming languages, including C#. ASP.NET offers features like
                        state management, authentication, and data access. It includes several sub-frameworks, such as
                        Web Forms, MVC (Model-View-Controller), Web API, and Razor Pages, which cater to different
                        application architectures and development styles.</p>

                        large class library known as the Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language
                        interoperability across several programming languages. It has its version numbering scheme, such
                        as 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, etc.</p>

                        designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. .NET Core has its version numbering scheme, such

                        provide to ensure consistency across different .NET platforms. It's essentially a set of APIs
                        that developers can rely on being available on any .NET implementation that claims to support a
                        particular version of .NET Standard.</p>

                        (CLR), which provides various services like garbage collection, exception handling, and

                <p>
                    In summary, .NET is a platform that encompasses multiple implementations like .NET Framework, .NET
                    Core, and now individual "versions" of .NET <span>8</span>, all aiming to provide a unified
                    development and runtime environment for building and running applications. Each flavor of .NET has
                    its own version numbering scheme to denote specific releases and updates, while C# serves as one of
                    the primary programming languages for developing applications within the .NET ecosystem.
